Problem statement
You are given two strings A and B. Find the index of the first occurrence of A in B. If A is not present in B, then return -1.

For Example:
A = “bc”, B = “abcddbc”.
String “A” is present at index 1, and 5(0-based index), but we will return 1 as it is the first occurrence of “A” in string “B”.

Time Complexity : O(N)
Space Complexity : O(1)

Code : 
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
int findIndexOf(string a, string b){
	auto it = b.find(a);
	if(it!=string::npos){
		return it;
	}
	return -1;
}
