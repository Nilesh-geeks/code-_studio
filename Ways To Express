Problem statement:
You are given the number ‘N’. The task is to find the number of ways to represent ‘N’ as a sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers.

Example:
N = 9
‘9’ can be represented as:
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
4 + 5 = 9
The number of ways to represent ‘9’ as a sum of consecutive natural numbers is ‘2’. So, the answer is ‘2’.
Note:
1. The numbers used to represent ‘N’ should be natural numbers (Integers greater than equal to 1).

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(1)

Code: 
#include<cmath>
int CountSumConsecutiveNums(int n) 
{
   int cnt =0 ;
   int max_k = sqrt(2*n);
   for(int i= 2; i<=max_k ; i++){
       int numerator = 2* n - i*(i-1);
       int denominator = 2*i;
       if(numerator%denominator ==0 && numerator/denominator>0)cnt++;
       
   }
    return cnt;
}
